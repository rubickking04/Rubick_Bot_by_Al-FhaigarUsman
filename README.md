<!-- Laravel is an open-source PHP framework for creating web applications. It is one of the most popular and widely used frameworks for web development, offering a simple, yet powerful set of tools for creating web applications. In this tutorial, we will show you how to install Laravel on your local development environment.

Step 1: Download and install Composer

Before you can install Laravel, you need to have Composer installed on your system. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP and it is used to manage the dependencies of the Laravel project. To download and install Composer, visit the official website and follow the instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Download Laravel

Once you have installed Composer, you can download the latest version of Laravel from their official website. You can also use the following command in your terminal to download the latest release:

composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist

This will download the Laravel files into a new folder in your current directory.

Step 3: Configure the Database

Once you have downloaded the Laravel files, you need to configure the database in order to use it. To do this, open the config/database.php file in your editor and edit the following lines:

'host' => env('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),

'username' => env('DB_USERNAME', 'root'),

'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD', ''),

Replace the values with the ones of your database. For example, if you are using MySQL, you should use 'mysql' as the host and 'root' as the username.

Step 4: Install the Dependencies

Once you have configured the database, you need to install the dependencies that are required for Laravel to work. To do this, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

composer install

This will install the required dependencies for the project.

Step 5: Start the Server

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

php artisan serve

This will start the server on your localhost and you can access it by visiting http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Congrats! You have successfully installed Laravel on your local development environment. You can now start building your awesome web applications. -->
